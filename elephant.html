                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are a select group of proboscideans belonging to the family Elephantidae. 
                        They are the largest existing land animals. 
                        Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, 
                        the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephantidae is the only 
                        surviving family of proboscideans; extinct members include the mastodons. The family Elephantidae 
                        also contains several extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. </p>
                    <p>
                        African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian 
                        elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of all 
                        elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, 
                        and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, 
                        and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, 
                        serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging.</p>
